# ZNCC-MVS

Multi-view stereo (MVS) plays a crucial role in computer vision, particularly in depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. PatchMatch-based MVS is a prominent branch of MVS and typically consists of four main steps: random initialization, propagation, multi-view cost evaluation, and refinement. Photometric consistency directly influences the propagation and update of depth information, serving as a key factor in ensuring accurate matching across different views. This paper proposes a cost computation method based on zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) to enhance matching accuracy and coherence in MVS. By leveraging the photometric consistency properties of ZNCC, we can more effectively evaluate the similarity between multiple views, thus optimizing the depth information propagation process. Experimental results show that using ZNCC for cost evaluation significantly improves the quality of depth maps and demonstrates greater robustness when handling complex scenes. This method offers a new perspective for MVS research and fosters the development of PatchMatch-based algorithms. The results indicate that our method effectively balances detail and low-texture area reconstruction, with improvements in reconstruction completeness of up to 4.9%.

Our code will come soon.
